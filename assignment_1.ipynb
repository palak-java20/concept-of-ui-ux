        "1. What is the significance of user-centered design in UI/UX?\n",
        "    User-centered design is important because it focuses on the actual users of the product. Instead of designing what we \"think\" users want, we involve them in the process like by doing research and getting their feedback. This helps us make better decisions and build something that’s really helpful and easy for them to use. It also helps in avoiding user frustration and increase satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How do wireframes contribute to the UI/UX design process?\n",
        "    Wireframes are like the rough draft of the design. They show where different elements like buttons, text, images will go, but without any colors or styling. This helps to plan the structure of the page properly. It’s also helpful to share with team or client for early feedback so changes can be made before going into the detailed design.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Explain the role of usability testing in improving user experience.\n",
        "    Usability testing is when real users try the design to see if it’s easy and understandable. We can watch how they use it and notice if they are facing any issues. It helps to fix those problems early and make the experience smoother. It basically helps in making the product more user friendly and useful.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Discuss the importance of accessibility in UI/UX design.\n",
        "    Accessibility is important because not everyone uses technology in the same way. Some users might have disabilities like vision or hearing problems. So we have to design in a way that they can also use the product without any problem. It also improves the overall experience for everyone, not just people with disabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are the key principles of effective visual design in UI/UX?\n",
        "    Some main principles are: maintaining consistency in fonts and colors, using proper spacing so things don’t look messy, using contrast so text is readable, and giving feedback like when a button is clicked. Also, important information should be highlighted or placed where user can notice easily. All these things together make a design clean and easy to interact.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. How do personas influence the design decisions in UI/UX projects?\n",
        "    Personas are fictional characters we make based on research. They help us to understand the target users better. For example, if we are designing for college students vs. old age users, our design and language will be different. So personas keep the design on the right track and remind us who we are actually building for.\n"
